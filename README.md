# Tic-Tac-Toe
As a beginner in programming you will go  through many videos or courses like - python for beginners , c programming for beginners ,
but when you complete the course of beginners  what will yoy gonna do after that so i have already completed these course and after doing research on google , youtube & other platform (can't saying a lot of research).
I got two ways for improving our programming skills,
1. Competitive Coding - which is little bit tougher as we are new and we don't know how to solve the algorithim or problem, so i left this option,
2. Make your own programming tutorial like games, softwares etc with the help of different search engines or any other stuff.

This is my first game which is Tic Tac Toe, and i am gona write and make about 10-15 games or software in this series to clear the whole concept and for improving skills.

THANXS IF YOU READ IT.

NOW GO THROUGH THE CODING.
